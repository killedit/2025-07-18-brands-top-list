## Installation
/It has been tested in the process of writing the documentation./

1. Required: [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/), [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/#install-the-plugin-manually).

    ```
    ```
    cd 2025-07-18-brands-top-list

3. Build the containers. Check for errors, i.e. a port could be in use by another process.

    ```
    docker compose up -d --build
    ```

4. DB migrations and seeding are handled by the entrypoint bash script `2025-07-18-brands-top-list/docker/php/entrypoint.sh`.

        show tables;
        exit;
    ```
